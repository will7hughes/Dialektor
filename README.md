[dialekt.appspot.com_version_Beta-0](https://dialekt.appspot.com/)

About Version Beta-0:<br>
Beta-0 is the almost finished version of the final product, lacking the final cosmetic touches and the researchers page and functionality. The sound recording, playback, storage, profile, collection all functional. 

### Important notes: 

#### A word about google cloud 
You may notice there are 3 files that are not part of a usual 
Django app. 
1. app.yaml <br>
This files contains the configuration to run the app in google cloud app engine.
2. requirements.txt <br> 
This is the file that can get by ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```. Contains all the project python dependencies.
Google cloud will look for this file and install all the listed packages.
3. main.py <br>
Google app engine looks for this file to starts the our application. In this file, we just restate our 
wsgi choice. 

This is a great article about the process:<br>

#### Installation and running locally

As usual, start with a git clone, <br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yasharAhari/Dialektor.git
```
go to the ```Dialektor_``` directory and run the following commands:<br>
#### Activate virtual python environment
Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
#### Install requirements
Make sure you are invoking pip with python3 and not python 2.7<br>
Depending on how you have setup pip, you can use pip3 to invoke as python3<br>
I choose to be extra verbose and specify with the below command<br>
Windows:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start Development Local Server
Windows:
```cmd
python manage.py runserver
```

linux
```bash
chmod +x manage.py 
./manage.py runserver
```
After this step the Development server will start working. 
You should be able to see the website on 
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)


#### Run Unit Tests
```bash
python manage.py test
```

#### Deployment on google cloud:
Each time after few feature implemented, I will be updating it to the Google cloud.
I am thinking to assign a version number to each upload as something like a release version. 

If you like to try it on your own google cloud account, I suggest you to follow the instructions on 
this link:
